What is the exploratory data analysis? According to the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis), Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.
