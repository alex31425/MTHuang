Statistics play an important role in baseball which makes comparisons between players on field performance easy, and these combined statistics can also evaluate each team overall performance for a given days. In this project, I used a historical dataset on a Major League Baseball (MLB) to derive meaningful insights into player and team performance and apply machine learning algorithms to project the a game result. This work analyzes the pitch and batter data with decision tree model, random forest model, K-Nearest model, Kernel SVM, and XGBoost model to study what factors would affect the teamsâ€™ performance.
