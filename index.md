Statistics play an important role in baseball which makes comparisons between players on field performance easy, and these combined statistics can also evaluate each team overall performance for a given days. In this project, I used a historical dataset on a Major League Baseball (MLB) to derive meaningful insights into player and team performance and apply machine learning algorithms to project the a game result. This work analyzes the pitch and batter data with decision tree model, random forest model, K-Nearest model, Kernel SVM, and XGBoost model to study what factors would affect the teamsâ€™ performance.

Airbnb is an online rental marketplace that allows hosts to post their properties for short-term rental. Airbnb logging service has revolutionized the hotel industry and played a key role in our sharing economy. Hosts have to keep monitoring the market, so they do not set the prices too high or too low.  Therefore, hosts need tools to help them price their property more conveniently and sufficiently. This analysis includes data analysis using data visualization on important features such as location and date and 5 different machine models (Simple linear regression, multiple linear regression model, Polynomial Linear regression model, decision tree regressor, Random Forest regression model, and XGBoost model), and compare which models can best predict the price. 
I am responsible for build the machine learning models to conduct predictive analytics which predicts the rental price.
